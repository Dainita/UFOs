# UFOs
## Overview
After building the UFO website, additional functionality was added by including multiple search fields. Adding search fields for the city, state, country, and shape of the UFO siting is intended to make the website more useful by making it easier for users to analyze the provided data. Search execution was also changed from a filter click button to using the enter button. These updates are expected to make the website easier to use and more popular with users to perform UFO data analysis. 
## Results
Users can search for sightings on the website by date, city, state, country, or shape by simply typing the data in the respective search field. The selected data populates upon pressing the enter button. If the user wants to know if a fireball shape sighting occured in multiple cities, a simple search of fireball in the shape search field quickly provides an answer. Multiple field searches can also be performed. Maybe a user is looking for all of the sightings in Florida on a certain date or triangle shape sightings only in el cajon. The answers to these questions are easily retrieved through the search fields integrated with the dynamic table on the website.

## Summary
The UFO website is functional and could prove useful to avid UFO followers. However, users need to know what feature they are searching for. A great improvement to the website would be to add a dropdown function to the search fields to alert the user of the options available. This would be especially helpful for the shape column which contains descriptions that are not actual shapes such as light, flash, and fireball. 

Adding a search field for the duration would also provide beneficial information to users. Sitings with a duration of a minute or more would appear more reliable than those of only a few seconds. The comments column also contains useful information. A search field to select keywords from the comments would improve functionality and popularity of the website.
